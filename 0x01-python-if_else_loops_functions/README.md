Below are the list of files and their functions respectively 
##

[lists.h](./lists.h) | Header file for task 13


[0-positive_or_negative.py](./0-positive_or_negative.py) This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative. 


[1-last_digit.py](./1-last_digit.py) This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number. 


[2-print_alphabet.py](./2-print_alphabet.py) Program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line. Using one print function with string format


[3-print_alphabt.py](./3-print_alphabt.py) program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line. Prints all the letters except q and e


[4-print_hexa.py](./4-print_hexa.py) Program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal (as in the following example). Using one print function with string format

 
[6-print_comb3.py](./6-print_comb3.py) program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits. Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space. The two digits must be different. 01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1


[7-islower.py](./7-islower.py) Function that checks for lowercase character . Prototype: def islower(c):


[8-uppercase.py](./8-uppercase.py) Function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line. Prototype: def uppercase(str):


[9-print_last_digit.py](./9-print_last_digit.py) Function that prints the last digit of a number. Prototype: def print_last_digit(number):


[10-add.py](./10-add.py) Function that adds two integers and returns the result. Prototype: def add(a, b):

 
[11-pow.py](./11-pow.py) Function that computes a to the power of b and return the value. Prototype: def pow(a, b):


[12-fizzbuzz.py](./12-fizzbuzz.py) Function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space. Prototype: def fizzbuzz():

 
[13-insert_number.c](./13-insert_number.c) Function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list. Prototype: listint_t *insert_node(listint_t **head, int number);
[lists.h](./lists.h) Header for Task 13 

[100-print_tebahpla.py](./100-print_tebahpla.py) Program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in uppercase) , not followed by a new line. Using one print function with string format

 
[101-remove_char_at.py](./101-remove_char_at.py) Function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position n (not the Python way, the “C array index”). Prototype: def remove_char_at(str, n):

 
[102-magic_calculation.py](./102-magic_calculation.py) Python function def magic_calculation(a, b, c): that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode:
